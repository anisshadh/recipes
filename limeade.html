    <p>
        Fresh, homemade limeade is a crisp and tangy refreshment perfect for warm days or anytime you want a burst of citrus. Using fresh-squeezed limes and real cane sugar gives it a bright, natural flavor that’s far superior to store-bought versions.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (about 6–8 limes)</li>
        <li>¾ cup cane sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>4 cups cold water</li>
        <li>Lime slices or wedges (optional, for garnish)</li>
        <li>Ice (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll the limes on the counter to loosen the juice, then cut and juice them until you have 1 cup of fresh lime juice. Strain out seeds and pulp if desired.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine ½ cup of the cold water with the cane sugar. Warm over low heat, stirring until the sugar fully dissolves (creating a simple syrup). Let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>In a pitcher, combine the fresh lime juice, simple syrup, and remaining cold water.</li>
        <li>Stir well and taste. Adjust sweetness by adding more sugar or water as needed.</li>
        <li>Chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve over ice and garnish with lime slices if desired.</li>
    </ol>
