    <h1>🍪 Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
    <p>A warm, freshly baked chocolate chip cookie is a timeless treat. This version uses real butter, pure vanilla, and a mix of brown and white sugars for that perfect chewy-meets-crispy texture, just like traditional homemade cookies should.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>¾ cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup (165g) packed brown sugar (light or dark)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups (280g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>½ tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>2 cups (340g) semisweet chocolate chips or chopped chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy (about 2–3 minutes).</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined, do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Scoop the dough into 1.5–2 tablespoon-sized balls and place them on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 9–11 minutes, until the edges are golden brown and the centers look slightly underbaked (they'll finish setting as they cool).</li>
        <li>Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
